## Overview

Trails is a full-stack application written in Django/Python using Django REST Framework, TailwindCSS, and Docker. This is an information blog documenting backpacking trips and hikes that I have completed over the years. Details such as mileage, weather, elevation, wildlife, trail conditions, and other fun things will be written in the description for each entry. Treat this as a way to help you prepare for your own trips!

This trip is a 4-5 day backpacking trip covering 52 miles located in the Cascades in Washington. The Glacier Peak Wilderness is located within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Our trip was in late July and the temperatures were warm but not horrible. We entered in at the Phelps Creek Trailhead and started with mostly forested hiking. We encountered a few people telling us later in the trip the bugs are far worse and to be prepared for this on the other side of Spider Gap in the Lyman Lakes basin. We continued to hike and eventually ended up in the beautiful Spider Meadows with green all around, waterfalls, and amazing mountain views. We made our way further up trail and made to a decent camping spot 100 yards before the Phelps Basin spur trail junction. (There is an amazing campsite half way between the Phelps Basin spur trail junction and the top of Spider Gap.) 

After a pleasant night, we woke up to a great breakfast and coffee and made our way up the trail to go see Phelps Basin before heading up to Spider Gap. We dropped backs and made our way up the basin a bit to see the nice views. We then retrieved our packs and began the very steep climb up to Spider Gap.
