## Overview

Trails is a full-stack application written in Django/Python using Django REST Framework, TailwindCSS, and Docker. This is an information blog documenting backpacking trips and hikes that I have completed over the years. Details such as mileage, weather, elevation, wildlife, trail conditions, and other fun things will be written in the description for each entry. Treat this as a way to help you prepare for your own trips!
